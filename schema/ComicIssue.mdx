rdfs:comment: "Individual comic issues are serially published as\n    \tpart of a larger series. For the sake of consistency, even one-shot issues\n    \tbelong to a series comprised of a single issue. All comic issues can be\n    \tuniquely identified by: the combination of the name and volume number of the\n    \tseries to which the issue belongs; the issue number; and the variant\n    \tdescription of the issue (if any)."
